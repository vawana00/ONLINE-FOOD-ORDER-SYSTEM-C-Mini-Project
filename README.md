# ONLINE-FOOD-ORDER-SYSTEM-C-Mini-Project
Online Food Ordering Systems alleviate in apprising the right people at the right stint. It is not just about obedience; it’s about shielding the customer’s essence by staying connected with them. As of now, the inclination of people is no longer to halt for food in restaurants. However, people do find it more spacious to get food at their doorsteps after a few minutes of placing the order through the system for food delivery. With people going through social hostility, self-quarantine, and staying indoors to stop the spread of the virus, food-delivery startups are in need more than ever. They cater to more orders than before. Food delivery companies can help people stay indoors and fight this pandemic. On this basis, a simple program which can be extended is written using C language.  

The program is destined to use login module in both customer and administrator section. The customers must first sign up and then login to place an order. The administrator section requires username and password which is built in the program itself. Only three attempts are given to enter correct password in this section.
To login administrator section, please use: 
Username: miniproject
Password: bbbs077
Note: Download all the data files to run the program. Few programs run reading the data files as they are opened in reading mode only. The program can be descripted as much as you want.
