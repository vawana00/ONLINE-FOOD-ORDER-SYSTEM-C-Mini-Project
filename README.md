# ONLINE-FOOD-ORDER-SYSTEM-C-Mini-Project
Online Food Ordering Systems alleviate in apprising the right people at the right stint. It is not just about obedience; it’s about shielding the customer’s essence by staying connected with them. As of now, the inclination of people is no longer to halt for food in restaurants. However, people do find it more spacious to get food at their doorsteps after a few minutes of placing the order through the system for food delivery. With people going through social hostility, self-quarantine, and staying indoors to stop the spread of the virus, food-delivery startups are in need more than ever. They cater to more orders than before. Food delivery companies can help people stay indoors and fight this pandemic. On this basis, a simple program which can be extended is written using C language.
